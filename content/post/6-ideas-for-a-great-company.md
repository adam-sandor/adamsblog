In this article I try to summarize what I like to see in a company that works according to my taste. All of it revolves around having an open and agile company culture. Based on my experiences and readings of many wise internet articles I believe that these principles make a company more effective at making money besides the obvious goal of being more happy while working there.

### Experimentation
Let's start with having a culture of constant experimentation. The world of software development is far too complex and
fast-changing for people to come to agreements on the right solution just by arguing on meetings. And any chosen solution becomes obsolete very fast so it's best not to place all bets on a single one but keep trying something new. Also fail fast when something doesn't work. Deciding by committee has the strong negative effect that so much time has
been spent arguing that no one will want to start over even when the chosen solution is showing signs of not being a very good idea after all.

Having the same solution applied to similar problems in different applications is also much overrated. If a solution is the official one just by virtue of it working on one project it prevents progress as there is no room to try new ideas. Having the same solution used all over the place has it's upsides in bringing down maintenance and training costs but a modern IT company should value innovation over keeping things neat and tidy. Good developers don't even blink when faced with having to learn a new framework after moving to another project.

### Low cost of failure
Supporting a culture of experimentation should be a culture where failure is accepted and people are trusted to admit to mistakes and improve because they want to excel and not because they fear what management will do to them. Of course the naive and easy way is to punish failure in some way because the company wants to succeed so it can't encourage people to fail, where would that lead to? People failing all the time probably... However unless you are hiring idiots you don't have to worry about people failing just because they are allowed to.

I have seen management telling people to be innovative (duh) while keeping everyone fearful of making the wrong choice. This can take the form of an unpleasant conversation about why didn't you ask X other people before taking that decision to explicitly being denied the right to take any decisions without prior approval.

The right approach is the exact opposite - try as many ideas as feasible, fail often and learn from it.

### Culture
The company culture shouldn't be a vague set of beliefs of the some of the more important people at the company. It should be a set of values agreed on by those people and preferably put into writing. I can't come up with anything better then the classic [Netflix culture slides](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/18-Seven_Aspects_of_our_Culture). Those are great, everybody should read them.
It's important to have things spelt out like this because it should inform people when resolving conflicts or when a decision needs to be made based on personalities (e.g. a promotion or hiring someone). It can prevent hiring the wrong people which again is important to uphold the values the company wants to stand for.
To make it really clear lets quote Netlix: "The actual company values, as opposed to the nice sounding values, are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted or let go". Far too often only lip service is paid to nice sounding values like innovation and honesty even while the people doing opposite get rewarded.

### Trust, responsibility & empowerment
Trust your employees and teach them to trust and respect each other. Trust them to the level of allowing them to make their own mistakes if they are willing and able to learn from them. Attending endless meetings to try to reduce the risk of certain decisions turns everything into tedious discussions that rarely improve the outcomes.
Still this doesn't mean decisions should be done of without any discussion. Managers can be part of the process if they make it very clear that the decision is still in the hands of the person who was given responsibility. Another form of cooperation is when someone higher in the pecking order turns to their team for advice. The balance of power is clear, no overruling can happen but the team will feel included in the decision. This is the best way to do things in my opinion. A process where one has to convince people with less knowledge but more decision power about every important decision inevitably leads to disengagement and apathy.
Experimentation should be the process that prevents serious mistakes by keeping an eye out whether a solution is delivering the results and changing direction early if it doesn't.

### Training & Coaching
Most companies recognize the need to send employees to some trainings to improve their work related skills. However helping someone to work effectively at the company requires more than that.

First of all people at the company have to have an idea about what behavior do they expect and it has to be communicated clearly. Of course it's impossible to spell everything out in written form so continual coaching and giving feedback should be order of the day instead of a once a year review meeting occasion.

An open and empowering culture is great but many people are not used to it, so there is plenty coaching to be done on how to act responsibly and cooperatively even while employees are encouraged to act rather then sit around on meetings. Many people are not used to working without someone giving them assignments and checking every step of what they do.

### Focus on efficiency not number of employees
Scale by continuously improving efficiency instead of by hiring more and more people. Similarly don't measure company success in number of employees but in how fast you can deliver a solution from idea to production.
There are many problems in an IT company that can be solved by either improving efficiency or more manual labor. Infrastructure automation, refactoring and architectural improvement is hard so companies tend to reach for the easy solution of hiring additional people. If this results in hiring lot of junior employees then a vicious cycle gets started where people with weak skills become critical in running processes, keeping up environments or maintaining applications no one else wants to touch. And there won't be anyone on the project anymore who could improve the situation. Listen to the people who complain about the state of some project and try as hard as you can to get them the resources they ask for to improve it. It gives a tremendous morale boost when you feel that you are trusted and have the ability to make your work more enjoyable and efficient.

### Disclaimer
To not make a blog post unreadably long some of the stuff is less nuanced than it could be so please don't point out that these are not absolute truths perfectly fitting every situation. I'm pragmatic and know very well that the real world is messy with many different people of different backgrounds and personalities having to work together. But I have no doubt that these are the ways of working a modern company should aspire to.
